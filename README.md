## Description

TypeScripts is a typing game for all developers, new and experienced, where they are able to see their typing skills when typing code. We noticed that a lot of the typing quizes or games didn't offer developer modes where you can type code instead of random words and sentences. with this being our very first full stack development project, we learned a lot about technical skills and social skills when working in a team.
